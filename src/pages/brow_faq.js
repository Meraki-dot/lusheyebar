                Please send photos of your bare brow, in several different
                lighting and angles prior to your appointment. If you have
                previous work it will cost an additional $100 and may require
                more than one touch up. If you book an appointment before
                submitting pictures, you might be turned away on the day of your
                appointment and your deposit will be forfeited.

                The retention depends on a number of factors, including skin
                type, lifestyle, health condition, sun exposure, etc. Generally
                it last for two years but often clients come in at one year for
                an annual color booster.

                We will numb your brow area before we begin. You may experience
                slight discomfort during the first pass but we will numb your
                brow again when the skin is open. You will not feel much
                afterwards.

                The initial healing period is 7-10 days. The complete healing
                process takes between 6-8 weeks. It should not be a problem
                going to work or doing daily activities as long as you are
                following the aftercare instructions.

                Immediately after the procedure, the tattooed area will appear
                to be darker, bolder in color and more defined. This will last
                up to 7-10 days after the treatment, while the initial healing
                process takes place.
